This project implements emotion recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify facial expressions into different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. It uses the FER-2013 dataset for training and supports real-time emotion detection via webcam. 
The goal is to develop a model that can accurately recognize emotions from facial images with a user-friendly interface.
